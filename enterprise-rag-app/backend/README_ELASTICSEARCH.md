# Elasticsearch setup

This project's vector store is Elasticsearch — the same engine the
production `chat_service.py`/`ingestor.py` in this repo run against.
Elasticsearch is a separate server process you install and start yourself,
but it's still **no Docker**: you download a ZIP, unzip it, and run a
`.bat` file.

Elasticsearch must be running and reachable at `ES_URL` (see `.env`)
**before** you start the backend — `python ingest.py`, `.\run.ps1`, and
every API call that touches the vector store all depend on it.

## 1. Download and extract

Go to the official Elasticsearch downloads page and get the **Windows ZIP**
distribution (not the MSI installer, not Docker):

https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch

Unzip it somewhere simple with no spaces in the path, e.g.
`C:\elasticsearch\`. You should end up with a `bin\elasticsearch.bat` inside
that folder.

You do **not** need to separately install Java — the Windows ZIP bundles its
own JDK.

## 2. Disable security for local-only dev use

Elasticsearch 8.x turns on TLS and password auth by default, which is the
right call for anything reachable over a network — but for a single laptop
that never leaves `localhost`, it just adds certificate/enrollment-token
friction. Open `config\elasticsearch.yml` in Notepad and add these two
lines at the bottom (don't delete what's already there):

```yaml
xpack.security.enabled: false
xpack.security.http.ssl.enabled: false
```

**This is a local-development shortcut, not something to do on a shared or
internet-reachable machine.** If this laptop is ever used to run
Elasticsearch somewhere other than localhost, security should stay on and
the app's `ES_USERNAME`/`ES_PASSWORD` in `.env` should be set instead.

## 3. Start it

In a PowerShell window:

```powershell
cd C:\elasticsearch\bin
.\elasticsearch.bat
```

First startup takes a minute or two. Leave this window open — like the
backend and frontend, Elasticsearch needs to keep running in its own
terminal. You'll know it's ready when the logs stop scrolling and settle
on a line mentioning `started`.

**Checkpoint:** open http://localhost:9200 in a browser. You should get a
JSON response with `"cluster_name"` and version info, no login prompt (since
security is disabled). If you get a certificate warning or login prompt,
step 2 didn't take — double check `elasticsearch.yml` and restart.

## 4. Configure the app

In `backend\.env`:

```
ES_URL=http://localhost:9200
ES_INDEX_PREFIX=rag
```

Leave `ES_USERNAME`/`ES_PASSWORD` blank (security is disabled per step 2).

Then ingest — `POST /ingest`, the UI's **Sync documents** button, or
`python ingest.py` — this writes into an Elasticsearch index named
`rag_documents` (`{ES_INDEX_PREFIX}_documents`).

**Checkpoint:** `curl http://localhost:9200/rag_documents/_count` (or open
that URL in a browser) should show a document count matching what
`GET /health`'s `chunks_indexed` reports.

## What's actually happening under the hood

`app/rag/vector_store.py`'s `ElasticsearchVectorStore` stores each chunk as
a document with a `dense_vector` field and searches with a `knn` query —
the same mapping style `ingestor.py` uses in the production app, just for
one simple `documents` index instead of separate manuals/JSM-ticket indices
with BM25 hybrid search, HyDE, and multi-query expansion layered on top.

## Stopping / resetting

- **Stop**: close the PowerShell window running `elasticsearch.bat`, or
  press Ctrl+C in it.
- **Reset all data**: stop Elasticsearch, delete the `data\` folder inside
  your Elasticsearch install directory, restart. This wipes every index on
  this Elasticsearch instance, not just this project's.
- **Reset just this project's index**: with Elasticsearch running, call
  `POST /ingest` again (it deletes and recreates `rag_documents` before
  reloading), or manually: `curl -X DELETE http://localhost:9200/rag_documents`.

## Windows-specific troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| `elasticsearch.bat` window shows a wall of red text and exits | Usually a heap size problem on a low-RAM laptop. Edit `config\jvm.options` and lower `-Xms`/`-Xmx` (e.g. to `1g` each) if the machine has 8GB RAM or less. |
| Backend logs a connection error to `localhost:9200` | Elasticsearch isn't running or hasn't finished starting yet — check its window for a `started` log line. Also confirm `ES_URL` in `.env` matches (`http://localhost:9200`, not `https://`). |
| Browsing http://localhost:9200 asks for a username/password | Security wasn't actually disabled — re-check `config\elasticsearch.yml` for both lines from step 2, save, fully stop and restart Elasticsearch. |
| Port 9200 already in use | Something else is already running on that port (maybe a previous Elasticsearch you forgot was open) — find and close it, or change `http.port` in `elasticsearch.yml` and update `ES_URL` to match. |
| Everything feels slow / laptop fans spin up | Elasticsearch, the backend, and the frontend are all running at once — normal on modest hardware. Close other applications if it's unusable. |
